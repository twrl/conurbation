This is the rewrite of my hobby operating system, which is a bit of a playground. Major developments are coming irregularly at the moment while I'm still merging in various past experiments and side projects.

The system is being written to be legacy-free. It assumes x64, SSE2, ACPI >5.0, and UEFI 2.x.
